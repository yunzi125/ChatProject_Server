<html><head>  <title>Rationale to implementation of Simplechat 6</title></head><body><p>In this exercise, we wanted to allow the users to communicate using an existing package calledDrawpad.  With this, users of the Simplechat system can draw in real-time and at the same time as otherusers.  Extending the Simplechat system to make use of this package is simple as Drawpad is independantfrom Simplechat.  It however depends on the presence of an Observable and an Observer; in this case, the <i>ChatClient</i> class and the client GUI. The implementation of Drawpad is described in a file located in the Drawpad package.</p><p>When using Drawpad, with Simplechat, we just incorporate a call to the constructor of <i>OpenDrawPad</i> into the <i>main()</i> method of <i>ClientGUI</i>.  The parameters of this callare an instance of <i>ChatClient</i> and an instance of <i>clientGUI</i>.  <i>ClientGUI</i> must bemodified in order to send all #linedraw commands emanating from the pad to the server and to ignore the ones emanating from <i>ChatClient</i>.  <i>ChatClient</i> must be instructed to notify all of its observers upon reception of a #linedraw command from the server.  <i>EchoServer</i> must be modified tosend all #linedraw commands to all the currently connected clients. This system works well in this caseas no command is ever received twice by the pad.  Note that both the instance of <i>ClientGUI</i>and of <i>OpenDrawPad</i> observe the same istance of <i>ChatClient</i>.  The drawpad ignores messages intended for the GUI, while the GUI ignores the messages intended for the drawpad.</p></body></html>
