  <title>Rationale to implementation of Drawpad</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>There are two major classes in the Drawpad package: <i>DrawPad</i> and <i>OpenDrawPad</i>.  The
first class contains all the necessary instructions to draw and to construct the GUI that is the heart
of the Drawpad application.  The second contains methods which make a call to the ones contained inside
the <i>DrawPad</i> class.</p>

<p>To function properly, Drawpad requires the presence of an Observable and an Observer.  To demonstrate
the use of Drawpad, we have provided a simple test class <i>StartDraw</i>.  This class is at the same
time an observer and observable.  It observes an instance of <i>OpenDrawPad</i> while at the same time
being observed by the same instance.  When users draw in the pad, it notifies all of its observers, via
the instance of <i>OpenDrawPad</i> that a line is to be drawn from point A to point B.  <i>StartDraw</i>
receives this message and notifies all of its observers of the fact that a line must be drawn from point
A to point B.  Since <i>OpenDrawPad</i> is the observer it notifies the pad to draw the line.  Although 
this may seem a little redundant (and indeed it is when using StartDraw), this type of a system
is handy in the case of client-server applications using DrawPad.</p>

<p>When drawing, Drawpad always uses lines.  Therefore, it always sends two points to its observers via
the #linedraw command.  Anytime a #linedraw command is received by the pad, it draws a line between the
two specified points.  Note that when a point is to be drawn, the two points in the #linedraw command
are identical.  Users have the option of drawing freehand or straight lines.  The straight lines can
be created by double clicking in one area.  If a previous point had been placed on the pad, a straight
line will be drawn to the current location of the mouse from that point.  The timing delay is 400ms and
the user may move the mouse no more than 10 pixels in either direction of the first click for the program
to recognize the input as a double-click.</p>

<p>Drawpad utilizes adapter classes to avoid having anonymous ones.  These are useful for cases when
the users moves the mouse, selects a menu item, etc.</p>
