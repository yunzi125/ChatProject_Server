<html><head>  <title>Rationale to implementation of Simplechat 5</title></head><body><p>This exercise also had only one goal: implementing a GUI for the Simplechat system.  Two solutionsto this exercise are propsed, one of which conserves the ChatIF interface, the other one does not.  Thesolution which does not conserve the ChatIF interface is more complex.</p><p>Solution 1 - Keeping the ChatIF interface</p><p>Implementing this solution is actually very easy.  The only thing that needs to be done is to replacethe code which initiates a console-based application by code that deals with Graphical User Interfaces(GUIs).  In our implementation, the <i>accept()</i> method is no longer necessary as code executed uponclicking on the "send" button has the same effect.  It will obtain the text in the TextField objectand send it to the server just as the <i>accept()</i> method did in Phase 4's <i>ClientConsole</i>.No change is necessary in the <i>ChatClient</i> class.</p><p>Implementing this solution is also quite simple on the server side.  The same steps followed on theclient-side need to be followed on the server side.</p><p>Solution 2 - Removing the ChatIF interface</p><p>This solution is much more complex.  First off, we eliminated the code that created a console application and replaced it with code to create a GUI.  We then made the <i>ChatClient</i> class a subclass of <i>java.util.Observable</i> and change all of the commands that refer to <i>ChatIF</i>'s <i>display()</i> method to <i>notifyObservers()</i>.  In our implementation, we overwrote the <i>notifyObservers()</i> in order to shorten the length of the file.  After that, we remove the <i>ChatIF</i> type instance variable and the reference to it in the constructor.  After, we make surethe UI no longer implements the <i>ChatIF</i>, instead we make it implement <i>java.util.Observer</i> and make all instances of the UI observers of an instance of <i>ChatClient</i>.  This allows for evengreater seperation of the UI and functional parts.  Also, our solution uses about a dozen adapterclasses.  These are an alternative to the use of anonymous classes.  These adapter classes are usedto deal with cases such as the selection of a menu item, the user hitting the enter key, etc. We also extended the <i>java.awt.List</i> class to create a list of clients.  We used one of the adapterclasses and the <i>StringList</i> class in both the client and server GUIs.  The use of the <i>StringList</i> class allows us to simplify the use of the GUI, allowing users to select other clientsfrom the list and execute commands (such as blocking messages) upon them without having to type. Notethat a few commands, such as #add, #remove, #echo and #noecho were added.  These are sent by the serverto instruct the client to add a client to the client list, remove a client from the list, replace all characters typed by the client by '*' (for password privacy) and to stop replacing characters by asterisks.</p><p>Implementing this solution on the server side is analogous to the steps in implementing it on the client side.  The differences follow.  Just as with the client, we replaced the console code for GUIcode. We made <i>EchoServer</i> observable and made the GUI observe an instance of that class.  The <i>notifyObservers()</i> method was also overriden in <i>EchoServer</i>. Just as with the client, the GUI no longer implements the ChatIF interface, but rather the <i>java.util.Observer</i> interface.  This solution also uses a dozen adapter classes and the <i>StringList</i> class.  The use of <i>StringList</i> and the adapter classes are identical to the reasons given for the client.  The server was also modified to send the #add, #remove, #echo and #noecho commands at the proper times.  The#add command is sent to all clients and the server GUI when a client completes the login procedure. The#remove command is sent when a client disconnects.  The #echo command is sent to a client when the nextexpected message from that client is a password.  The #noecho command is sent to a client upon receptionof the password.</p></body></html>
